1. One AI runs to investigate the source, 2 AI joins, 3 AI joins, 4-th asks and gets reject, 5-th heard reject and doesn't join
2. 2 Groups of AI with 2 members hear the source, combine into 2 vs 2 groups, meet each other in a middle and keep 3 AI investigating, 1 returns to passive
3. AI ignores any dialogue with allies, ally asks, other AI hears that there is no reply and replies to leave first AI alone
4. 2 AI investigate the sound, 3-rd AI knows about that 4-th nope. When second sound emits, 3-rd AI ignores the sound totally (they knows ally will check that) 4th AI becomes sus first, but hears that others will handle that and calms down.

Overall to check every case you should step into volume with a text, that describes every case, then press C and fly to specific room for show. You will have 3 (or 5 seconds) before object make a noise to interest AI. For that I just press world pause, fly close and check the scene.
